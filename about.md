  About me
</div>
<div class="manual-content">
  Hi,
  <p>I'm a software developer that started in the Java world and have moved to Scala somewhere along my way. Currently I'm living in Berlin, Germany and working for Zalando, a tech (and fashion - not necessarily in this order) company.</p>
  <p>This blog will be mainly for me, for several reasons but to just mention a few:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>to help me putting down to words the research I make and to be sure I fully understood the said research;</li>
      <li>for future quick check - my memory is not the best and I tend to research multiple times the same subject;</li>
      <li>make me write - improving my communication skills.</li>
    </ul>
  <p>If I manage in the process to help at least some other person, it will be definitely worth it.</p>
  <p>Feedback is always appreciated, so if you want to tell me something, please do - specially if I wrote something wrong.</p>

  What to expect from this blog
</div>

<div class="manual-content">
  <p>Not much honestly. The plan to start slowly and hope to not forget about it.</p>
  <p>If everything goes according to plan, you can see posts about what I'm currently working on or about some of my hobbies.</p>
  <p>Subjects should go from Scala, PostgreSQL, Cassandra, Akka, agile methodologies, keyboards, video games or whatever comes to my mind.</p>
